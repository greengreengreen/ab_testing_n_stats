# Udacity-AB-Test
This project designed and analyze an A/B test for the "Free Trial Screener" change of Udacity course page. </br>
In the project, I started from experiment design(choosing metrics, calculating sizes) to experiment analysis(sanity check, effect size tests and sign tests) to giving the final recommendation. </br>
The detailed report including the test codes could be found in the [ Report.md ](https://github.com/greengreengreen/Udacity-AB-Test/blob/master/Report.md).
